# Project 1

Web Programming with Python, Flask and Jinja2

1. Project is created with the sole intention to understand the workings of web app development.
2. I've tried to keep the code simple and easy to read.
3. There is only one API as per the requirements /api/:book_isbn
4. Routes: `/`, `/login`,`/register`, `/user-registration`, `/books`, `/book/:id`, `/search` and `/logout`
5. App database is currently hosted with heroku free account.
6. I have postgres for data storage and interaction purpose. It was fun.
7. I have used only two css files across templates - `login.css` and `books.css`
8. App maintains user session as long as you don't logout.
9. It looked tedious to display 5k books on `books` page, so I have used a function which displays only 15 books randomly.
